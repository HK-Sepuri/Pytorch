# CV Self-Learning Tutorial: Get Started with Computer Vision

This course follows my own learning as i learn i try it out with some datasets from kaggle

### Desription
 * Part 1: An introdution to a simple Cnn in Pytorch
 * Part 2: A Can with custom Dataset and Dataloader
 * Part 3: A Deep Cnn and its impact in accuracy
 * Part 4: How Resnet model helps with Deep Cnn issues 
 * Part 5: Using Transfer learning/fine tuning on pre train models improves accucracy 
 * Part 6: Using Pytorch Image Models (timm) for Transfer learning/fine tuning
 * Part 7: Using Fastai library for less boiler code and rapidly productive
 * Part 8: Medical dataset using self created model vs fastai-timm create model
