# CV Self-Learning Tutorial: Get Started with Computer Vision

This course follows my own learning as i learn and try it out with some datasets on kaggle

### Desription
 * Part 01: An introdution to a simple Cnn in Pytorch.
 * Part 02: A Cnn with custom Dataset and Dataloader.
 * Part 03: A Deep Cnn and its impact in accuracy.
 * Part 04: How Resnet model helps with Deep Cnn issues.
 * Part 05: Using Transfer learning/fine tuning on pre train models improves accucracy. 
 * Part 06: Using Pytorch Image Models (timm) for Transfer learning/fine tuning.
 * Part 07: Using Fastai library for less boiler code and rapidly productive.
 * Part 08: Medical dataset using self created model vs fastai-timm create model.
 * Part 09: If you dont have a model for transfer learning , you train a model with unlabed datasets and save the model for transfer learning on labed datasets.
 * Part 10: An Autoencoder is a neural network that learns to compress data into a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstruct it from that compressed form.
 * Part 11: A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) learns a compressed code with added randomness to recreate data, allowing for generating new similar data.
